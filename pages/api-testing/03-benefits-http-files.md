# <tabler-world-star /> Benefits of `.http` Files

- Human-readable API requests
- Run directly from your editor
- Easy to document & version control
- Great for fast testing & debugging
- Supports environments & variables

<!--
Speaker Notes:

`.http` files are a lightweight and readable way to test and document REST APIs, especially useful during development.

- First, they’re **human-readable**—you can write and read requests like text, with no need for JSON-heavy payloads or `curl` syntax.
- They integrate smoothly with editors like **VS Code** or **JetBrains IDEs**, allowing you to execute HTTP requests inline, without needing tools like Postman or Insomnia.
- They’re **easy to version control**, since they’re plain text—this makes them perfect for collaboration and review in codebases.
- Developers love them for **quick testing and debugging** during backend work, frontend API integration, or prototyping.
- Finally, they support **environment variables**, so you can use the same file for development, staging, and production just by switching environments.

This combination makes `.http` files a powerful yet simple tool in any modern dev workflow.
